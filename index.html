                Starting my long journey, I started working in my Parents clinic for a little over 2 years, and really got my feet wet in the industry for working. I was running their entire office, sorting through files, making sales calls. Right after that I jumpped into being #1 internship class in the world at NorthWestern Mutal #1 office #1 district #1 internship overall for Finance; where I learned to set my own appointments, learned how to conduct meetsing, and have a sense of professionalism at all times. Afterwords I trained under Vince Walters who was the complete manager for all of Texas for Zynex medical. One phone call was worth 30 grand to himself at that point. He taught me alot, how to manage my own terrioty. I did a ton of amazing things from managing my own territory, and conference calls with the CDC. Afterwards took a little break... Went on to be a Sales executive at the #1 SEO company; created my own entertainment compnay & was the general manager at Dubai investments, having anywhere from million dollar days to disgrunteled guest. Now I am a Senior Account Executive at Hammer-Corporation still run Stratum Entertainment bringing joy across the metroplex. (Off the record own a few first page listings as well.)
